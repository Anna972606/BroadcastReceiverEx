# BroadcastReceiverEx
Broadcast Receiver is indeed a suitable mechanism to monitor WiFi state changes in Android.

Directly connecting to a Wi-Fi network programmatically without user interaction is generally discouraged due to security concerns. Users should be prompted to connect to Wi-Fi networks through the system settings.
